## Getting to know the basics 

# R is a programming language that has become the standard in Ecology due to its flexibility and open source nature. R can be used from simple math to complex models and is very useful for generating figures. R, like all computer languages, using a specific syntax to run commands that it is programmed to do. In other words, R will only do what it is commanded to do, and therefore, many common errors are due to errors in syntax (e.g. misspellings, missed commas, or unclosed brackets). 
# 
# This example gives a basic intro into R syntax that can be useful for ecological research. This script gives examples of how to:
#   
# 1.  Working with dataframes (10 min)
# 2.  Indexing (5 min)
# 3.  Conditional Statements (5 min)
# 4.  For loops (5 min)
# 5.  Vector operations (5 min)
# + Custom Functions
# + `purr`
# 6.  Figures with `ggplot2` (5 min)
# + Combining plots
# 7. Practice Exercises (30 min)

## Working with `dataframes` and `tibbles`
#Using either `dataframes` or `tibbles` will likely be the most common data structure for ecological data. Making these data structures is easy with the `data.frame()` or `tibble()` functions. Tibbles have more flexibility than dataframes and are part of the `tidyverse`. Dataframes are base R. When reading in tabular data, `read.csv()` will create a dataframe, while `read_csv()` will generate a tibble. `read_csv()` can be paired with `url()` to use data directly from the internet from sites like github. Note that if from github the raw file (click on raw tab when looking at github file) is needed for this to work.

library(tidyverse)
# create a dataframe

df = data.frame(name = c('GOOG', 'AMC', 'GME'),
                Jan = c(1000, 2, 4),
                Feb = c(1010, 15, 30),
                March = c(1005, 25, 180))

df

# create a tibble
tib = tibble(name = c('GOOG', 'AMC', 'GME'),
             Jan = c(1000, 2, 4),
             Feb = c(1010, 15, 30),
             March = c(1005, 25, 180))

tib

#read in data file on computer
# change file path to path location on computer
read.csv('data/LDWFBayAnchovy2007.csv')

read_csv('data/LDWFBayAnchovy2007.csv')

# read in data file from github
# need to use raw file
read_csv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PCB5423/BSC6926_workshopScripts/master/data/LDWFBayAnchovy2007.csv'))


### Renaming and making columns
#There are a few different ways to create a new column. The base R way is to use `$` with the object name of the dataframe on the left and the new column name on the right. This can be used to do vector operations as well. The other way is to the `mutate()` function which is part of the `dplyr` package in tidyverse. This function alows for more flexibility and can be very useful. The easiest way to rename columns is with `dplyr` functions like `rename()` or within function like `select()`.

df = tibble(name = c('GOOG', 'AMC', 'GME'),
            Jan = c(1000, 2, 4),
            Feb = c(1010, 15, 30),
            March = c(1005, 25, 180))

df$new = 'new column'

df$tot = df$Jan + df$Feb + df$March

df 

# using mutate
df = df %>% 
  mutate(newCol = 'blue')

# multiple columns at a time
df = df %>%
  mutate(sum = Jan + Feb + March, 
         big = sum > 500)
df

# rename columns
df %>%
  rename(Name = name, January = Jan, February = Feb)

# rename, reorder, only include certain columns 
df %>%
  select(Name = name, January = Jan, sum, everything())

# order data frame
df %>% 
  arrange(sum)

df %>% 
  arrange(desc(sum))


### Summarizing data
#There are a few different useful ways to summarize the data in a dataframe or tibble. If you want to know everything about the dataframe, then the base function `summary()` is useful. If you would like to have more control to create summary tables, then `dplyr::summarize()` or `dplyr::summarise()` are great. This can be paired with `group_by()` to summarize over specific groups of data.


summary(iris)

iris %>% 
  summarize(mean(Petal.Width),
            sd(Petal.Width))

iris %>% 
  group_by(Species)%>%
  summarize(mean(Petal.Width),
            sd(Petal.Width))

### Merging and combining mulitple dataframes
#Combining data together is very common, and depending on the type of combination needed. 

#### Binding
#If data has the same column names and needs to paste together, then `rbind()` and `dplyr::bind_rows()` are the tools need. For `rbind()`, the column names need to have the same name. `bind_rows()` does not have this problem.

# bind data together 
sal = tibble(species = rep(c('Salmon'),times = 3),
             year = c(1999,2005,2020),
             catch = c(50, 60, 40))

cod = tibble(species = rep('Cod', times = 3),
             year = c(1999,2005,2020),
             catch = c(50, 60, 100))

crab = tibble(species = rep('Crab', times = 3),
              catch = c(50, 60, 100),
              effort = c(20, 30, 50))

#Same column names
rbind(sal,cod)

#Error - Why?
rbind(sal, crab)

#Advantage of using bind_rows
bind_rows(sal, cod)

bind_rows(sal, crab)

#### Merge/Join
# If two data frames contain different columns of data, then they can be merged together with the family of join functions.
# 
# +`left_join()` = uses left df as template and joins all matching columns from right df 
# +`right_join()` = uses right df as template and joins all matching columns from left df
# +`inner_join()` = only matches columns contained in both dfs
# +`full_join()` = combines all rows in both dfs

left = tibble(name = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
              n = c(1, 6, 7), 
              bio = c(100, 43, 57))

right = tibble(name = c('a', 'b', 'd', 'e'),
               cals = c(500, 450, 570, 600))

#Indexing by left
left_join(left, right, by = 'name')
#Indexing by right
right_join(left, right, by = 'name')
#Commons
inner_join(left, right, by = 'name')
#All
full_join(left, right, by = 'name')

# multiple matches
fish = tibble(species = rep(c('Salmon', 'Cod'),times = 3), #repeating vector 3 times
              year = rep(c(1999,2005,2020), each = 2),
              catch = c(50, 60, 40, 50, 60, 100))

col = tibble(species = c('Salmon', 'Cod'),
             coast = c('West', 'East'))

left_join(fish, col, by = 'species')

##  Indexing
#Once data is stored in an object, being able to retrieve those values is useful. Referred to as indexing, the syntax is specific to how the data is stored. With indexing specific values within your object can be modified. 

# vector 
b = 1:15
# 3rd object 
b[3]

# make a character vector 
c = c('a', 'b', 'c')
c
# 2nd object
c[2]
# change 
c[2] = 'new'
c

# dataframe and tibbles
mtcars
# first column
mtcars[1]
# first row
mtcars[1,]
# 2nd row of first column
mtcars[2,1]
# can call specific columns (called as a vector)
mtcars$mpg
mtcars$cyl
#same for tibble
d = mtcars %>% as_tibble
d[1]
d$mpg
d$cyl
# specific row in specific column
mtcars$cyl[1]
d$cyl[1]

#Encourage to look at how indexing lists - It could be tricky!!!

## Conditional statements - Personal knowledge
#Skip in class

# In programing there are times that if something is true then you want an operation to occur, but not when a condition is not true. 
# ### Base R
# These can be done with `if` and `if else` statements in base R. These are written if a condition is true then the operation is done. They can be built upon with `else if` if the first condition is false to do test a second condition. If you want it to be If true and if false do something else then `if` and `else` structure can be used. 

b = 5 

if (b == 5){
  cat('b = 5 \n') # \n is carriage return to end line when printing
}

if (TRUE){
  c = 6
}else(
  c = 10
)
c 
if (F){
  c = 6
}else(
  c = 10
)
c 

if (b == 10){
  cat('b = 10 \n')
}else if (b == 5){
  cat('it worked \n')
}else{
  cat('nothing \n')
}

### `dplyr` functions
#`dplyr` has two functions that are very useful for conditional statements. Because they are a function they can be vectorized which will be useful as you see below. `if_else()` is a function that based on if the input is `TRUE` or `FALSE` produces a different answer. `case_when()` is more flexible and allows for multple outputs based on conditions being `TRUE`

x = 1:20

if_else(x > 10,
        'x > 10',
        'x < 10')


case_when(x < 6 ~ 'x < 6',
          between(x, 6, 15) ~ '6 < x < 15',
          x > 15 ~ 'x > 15')


##  For loops
#Another useful tool in programming is `for` loops. For loops repeat a process for a certain number of iterations. These can be useful iterate over a dataset or when using information in a time series. The `for` loop works over the number sequence indicated and does the code within the loop (inside of `{}`) for each number in the sequence. The iteration is typically indicated with `i`, but is just an object that is replaced at the begining of each loop and can be anything.

for(i in 1:10){ #Sequence
  print(i)      #body
}

#The iterator could be assigned to any letter or word assigment
for(turtle in 5:10){
  print(turtle)
}

for(flower in 1:nrow(iris)){
  cat('The species for this iteration is ',     #Adding text per row based on name species
      as.character(iris$Species[flower]), '\n') #note of importance of "\n
}

d = seq(1,15, 2) #8 elements
d
for(i in 1:length(d)){
  b = d[i] + 1                            #for each i add 1
  cat('d =',d[i], 'b = d + 1 =', b, '\n' )#then add string
}

b = 1:10
for (i in 2:10){    #Call a section of vector to start sequence
  z = b[i] - b[i-1]
  
  cat('z =', z, 'b[i] =', b[i], 'b[i-1] =', b[i-1], '\n')
}


start = 10 
pop = tibble(time = 0:10, n = NA) #Output vector size 10
pop$n[pop$time == 0] = start
pop
for (t in 1:10){ #sequence 
  growth = rnorm(n =1, mean = 3, sd = 1) #extracting random value normal dist
  pop$n[pop$time == t] = growth + pop$n[pop$time == (t-1)]
}
pop

##  Vector operations 
#As we have seen above, we can do operations over vectors. We sometimes want to do this to vectors stored in dataframes/tibbles, and the `mutate()` function makes this easy. 
iris %>% 
  mutate(petalArea = Petal.Length*Petal.Width)

iris %>%
  mutate(petalArea = Petal.Length*Petal.Width,
         PetalSize = if_else(condition = petalArea > 0.2, true ='big',
                             false = 'small'))

iris %>%
  mutate(petalArea = Petal.Length*Petal.Width,
         PetalSize = if_else(condition = petalArea > 0.2, true ='big',
                             false = 'small'))%>%
  group_by(PetalSize)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Petal.Width),
            n())

## `purr` = better than apply or lapply family
# The newest and new standard package with `tidyverse` is `purr` with its set of `map()` functions. Some similarity to `plyr` (and base) and `dplyr` functions but with more consistent names and arguments. Notice that map function can have some specification for the type of output.
# + `map()` makes a list.
# + `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
# + `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
# + `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
# + `map_chr()` makes a character vector.

df = iris %>%
  select(-Species)
#summary statistics
map_dbl(df, mean)
map_dbl(df, median)
map_dbl(df, sd)

###
#Creating models by group
#Similar of what we did with plyr and dplyr examples
###
data(mtcars)

models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))

models %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map_dbl(~.$r.squared) #or map_dbl("r.squared")

###
#Mapping over multiple arguments
###

mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
mu %>% 
  map(rnorm, n = 5) %>% #rnorm - function to extract values from a normal continuous distribution based on some parameters
  
  str()
#> List of 3

#Adding SD as well
sigma <- list(1, 5, 10)
seq_along(mu) %>% 
  map(~rnorm(5, mu[[.]], sigma[[.]])) %>% 
  str()
#> List of 3

###
#map2 or pmap allows you to iterate over two or more vectors in parallel
###
map2(mu, sigma, rnorm, n = 5) %>% str()

#or with pmap
n <- list(1, 3, 5)
args2 <- list(mean = mu, sd = sigma, n = n)
args2 %>% 
  pmap(rnorm) %>% 
  str()


## Figures with `ggplot2` 
# The `ggplot2` package is part of the packages that load with `tidyverse` and has become the standard in ecology. The syntax builds upon on a base function and is very customizable [see cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). 
# 
# The base of all `ggplot2` begins with `ggplot()` and `geom_...()` are built upon them

# ## Exercises 
# 1.    Read in the LDWFBayAnchovy2007.csv and create a column that calculates the catch per unit effort (CPUE) for Bay anchovy within the dataframe.
# 
# 2.    Create a dataframe or tibble that contains the basin names for the LDWFBayAnchovy2007.csv dataset (Barataria, Terrebonne, Ponchartrain, Vermilion-Teche, and Calcasieu) and the and abbreviation for each basin as a new column. 
# 
# 3.    Merge the dataframe/tibbles from exercises 1 and 2. 
# 
# 4.    Plot the CPUE for each basin both over time and as a summary of the entire year using a different color for each basin.
